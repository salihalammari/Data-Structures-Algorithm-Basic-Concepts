## what is an algorithm?

Algoritm 
	- A set of steps or instructions for completing a task. or a set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

```bash
print('Hello World)
```

### Linear Search
For linear search the input can be generally described as a series of values and the output is a value matching the one we're looking for. but once we get to code we can actually tighten this up, once we have a problem an algorithm is a set of steps that solves this problem given that the next guideline is that an algorithm definition must contain a specific set of instructions in a particular order

# Algorithm: 
Should produce a result if it didn't how would we know whether the algorithm works or not 

1. Start at beginning 
2. Compare current value to target
3. Move sequentially
4. Reach end of list






##What is Data Structure:

    A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. 

##### A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.


## Classification of Data Structure: 


<ul>
	<li><strong>Linear data structure:</strong>&nbsp;Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.&nbsp;<br />
	<em>Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.</em>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Static data structure:&nbsp;</strong>Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.&nbsp;<br />
		<em>An example of this data structure is an array.</em></li>
		<li><strong>Dynamic data structure:&nbsp;</strong>In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.&nbsp;<br />
		<em>Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Non-linear data structure:&nbsp;</strong>Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can&rsquo;t traverse all the elements in a single run only.&nbsp;<br />
	<em>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.</em></li>
</ul>

####What is a data structure?

Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy). Just as you will likely select a spoon to eat a bowl of soup rather than a knife, you will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with. When you begin learning basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists, you will start to conceptualize how data is stored, searched, and edited, and what these operations will contribute to the space/time complexity of your program at runtime (this will make more sense once you start to learn about Big O notation). As you continue to learn more complex data structures, you may notice that you need to think more abstractly and deliberately in order to properly implement them. But with patience and practice you will begin to see patterns emerge that will allow you to intuitively see which situation calls for which data structure, just as you know to pick up a spoon when you see a bowl of soup.

* This chapter explains the basic terms related to data structure.

##Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.

** Atomic − Definition should define a single concept.

** Traceable − Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.

** Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.

** Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable.

####Data Object
Data Object represents an object having a data.

####Data Type
Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. There are two data types −

* Built-in Data Type
* Derived Data Type
